# SplunkDashboard
A simple Splunk Enterprise dashboard designed to detect Eternal Blue exploit attempts on Windows devices.

Required for a group assignment in which our fictional client required a technical solution to protect his company's systems from Eternal Blue style attacks using Metasploit. I originally made a more general SIEM display, but stripped it back to focus on the scope we were give.
